# ðŸ§© Microservice Overview

Each service is a subclass of [MicroService](microservice/microservice.py), publishing `update` events via Redis `Pub/Sub`.

They can run continuously (recommended) or be instantiated in single-shot mode for isolated updates. Secrets and configuration are managed via [SecretManager](https://github.com/dekeyrej/secretmanager), with deployment defined in Kubernetes YAMLs.

### âš¾ MLB Polling Logic

The MLB microservice follows a dynamic update cycle:

- **11:30 AM EDT** â€“ wakes and checks the dayâ€™s schedule  
- **Pre-game** â€“ sleeps until the first game starts  
- **During games** â€“ polls every 30 seconds  
- **Post-game** â€“ sleeps until 11:30 AM the next day
