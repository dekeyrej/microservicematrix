# microservicematrix
Microservices Implementation of the matrix server

'Strangling' the kubematrix code base - 
-- Peeling off each of the 'servers'
-- making modifications as required to run standalone
-- creating a copy of the Dockerfile for each
-- testing, and when successful
-- commenting it out of the kubematrix monolith
